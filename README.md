# FSRoot

FSRoot is a set of utilities, built around the CERN ROOT framework, that can be used
to analyze a variety of final states (FS) produced in particle physics experiments.

See Documentation/FSRoot.pdf for documentation, including installation instructions.

This branch is experimental, and includes functionality for looking at reconstructed neutrons.
